📝 Challenge: Portfolio Generator 

In this activity, you will build a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.

## Instructions
Your application should:

Prompt the user for the following information:

✅ Their name

✅ Their location

✅ A short bio

✅ Their LinkedIn URL

✅ Their GitHub URL

(Optional) Add any extra prompts you’d like (skills, projects, etc.)

Create an HTML document with the collected information

Add CSS styling to make the page visually appealing

Write the HTML to the file system

## Tools & Technologies
You’ll need:

inquirer – for user prompts

fs – to write the HTML file

Template literals – to generate the HTML as a string

💡 Hints
First build a sample HTML layout in a browser to see what you want.

Then convert that to a JavaScript template literal with placeholders.

Use JSON.stringify() only if you're writing JSON — not for HTML.

Keep your styling clean and in one section of the page (or inject a <style> tag).
